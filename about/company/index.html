<li>President, Total Sim LLC</li>
</ul>

<p>Ray Leto, a 25+ year veteran of open wheel racing, received a BS in Aerospace Engineering from Penn State in 1985 and began his career by working his way up through the motorsports ranks as a mechanic and engineer.</p>

<p>Ray joined Truesports Company Racing in 1988 as an Engineer and in 1991&amp; 92 worked with winning racer Scott Pruett. As a key member of Team Rahal, Leto spent 15 years honing his craft working under the direction of team owner Bobby Rahal. Ray worked within the Rahal organization in many roles including Race Engineer, Aerodynamicist, Chief Race Engineer, Technical Director, CART Team Manager, and Acting General Manager.</p>

<p>Ray helped guide Bryan Herta to his first two career CART series wins, and while managing the CART operations at Team Rahal, Ray helped Jimmy Vasser win in Fontana in 2002, and notched several CART victories, and poles with Michel Jourdain in 2003. Switching to the IRL in 2004, Ray returned his focus to aerodynamics and simulation helping the team achieve multiple wins and poles including the 2004 Indy 500 with Buddy Rice. Ray then managed the race engineering and strategy for the 2005 Indy and IndyCar Series Rookie of the Year Danica Patrick during her break-out seasons in 2005 and 2006.</p>

<p>Ray brings more than 20 years of high pressure racing experience to his role as president of Total Sim LLC, based in Dublin, Ohio. He continues innovation and leadership as an accomplished Engineer and Manager lending his extensive aerodynamic experience, a strong focus on simulation, systems integration, and program implementation to clients in motorsports and other fields where rapid change is essential.</p>

<li>Technical Director, Total Sim LLC</li>
</ul>

<p>Naethan graduated in 1993 with an honors degree in Aeronautical Engineering from City University London. He joined a small R&amp;D company that same year which provided experimental and CFD consulting services to the HVAC industry. He moved to Rolls-Royce PLC in early 1997 working on the development of the Trent series of gas turbine engines, using a combination of CFD and FEA technologies.</p>

<p>In late 1998, Naethan joined Rob Lewis at Advantage-CFD initially to work with BAR F1 on their aero development program. Together Naethan and Rob went on to spearhead the aero consulting arm of ACFD, working on projects as diverse as Champ Car and Indy Racing aero development, all the way to alternative power generation systems.</p>

<p>Naethan left ACFD in the summer of 2001 to start the CFD Department at the BMW-Williams F1 Team. Over the next ten years he grew the size and scope of the department, integrating the use of CFD into the aerodynamic design process, placing CFD at the heart of all aero development, and making CFD the primary tool for all conceptual aero work, cooling studies, and structural load determination. Naethan became a key part of the small team at Williams that set the design and development direction for all their projects.</p>

<p>Naethan has extensive experience in full-scale wind tunnel and track testing, including instrumentation, data capturing, and data reduction. His experience of successfully taking designs from concept through CFD and model scale wind tunnel testing, to implementation and verification on the actual vehicle gives him a rare combination of advanced modeling skills and practical understanding of racecar development.</p>

<p>Naethan decide to leave Williams F1 in 2010 to join TotalSim so he can transfer what he&rsquo;s learned during his time at the &lsquo;bleeding edge&rsquo; of motorsports and design and bring it to bear on new areas and project types. As of January 2011 Naethan has become a fulltime member of the TotalSim USA team and will be a great resource and asset not only for TotalSim, but all of our customers as well.</p>

<li>Board Member, Total Sim LLC</li>
<li>Managing Director, TotalSim Ltd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rob Lewis graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Leeds University in 1991 and winning a PhD scholarship to stay at Leeds and study CFD codes for combustion. After being awarded his PhD in 1994, Rob joined FLUENT Europe where he managed a team of support and consulting engineers.</p>

<p>In late 1997, Rob left FLUENT to start AdvantageCFD (A-CFD) with Adrian Reynard at Reynard Motorsports. A-CFD supported all of Reynard Motorsports designs from Champ Car to the BAR F1 cars. Rob grew the A-CFD organization to 25 people by late 2006 when it was an essential part of Honda F1 Aerodynamics Dept. AdvantageCFD succeeded in setting the standard in motorsport CFD from inception to its closure in 2007, including Rob’s pioneering use of OpenFOAM. The switch in focus away from any outside consulting by the Honda F1 Racing Team gave Rob and some of the team at A-CFD the chance to continue working with their clients by creating a new company, TotalSim Ltd, which they formed as a largely employee owned company in early 2007.</p>

<p>Currently, Rob is Managing Director of TotalSim Ltd. which employs 16 staff in Brackley, UK with over 1000 cores of compute resource. TotalSim Ltd. has become the worldwide leader in the use of OpenFOAM for Motorsports and Automotive CFD and continues to grow and expand.</p>

<p>Having worked together while at A-CFD and Team Rahal respectivly, Rob and Ray began discussions in 2007 on the idea of forming a US version of TotalSim to service key clients, and expand the use of OpenFOAM in the USA. In early 2009, Total Sim LLC started as a joint venture between TotalSim Ltd and the employees of this new company based in the US. Rob and TotalSim Ltd are also expanding into Italy via a new partnership with Y-Com forming Y-Sim in mid-2010.</p>

<p>Sergio Rinland is an immensely respected designer and leader with an exceptional record of achievement in the competitive field of Formula One and Sports Car racing, having acted as Design Engineer, Chief Designer and Technical Director.</p>

<p>Sergio received his Engineering degree and began his racing career in his native Argentina. Moving to the UK and Europe in the early 1980’s, Segio worked his way up in Formula One as a Designer and Race Engineer, eventually becoming Chief Designer for some of the top teams in F1.</p>

<p>Over the past 4 years Sergio lead the engineering team at Epsilon in Spain including working with and instructing at the University there.</p>

<p>Since early 2011 Sergio has refocused his efforts on his consulting company Astauto Ltd. that he established in 1991. Astauto services provided covered a wide range of disciplines from the design and development of complete cars and components to aerodynamic, vehicle dynamics, and structural analysis to development of existing vehicles using the latest technologies and simulation methods. Astauto is also heavily involved in Alternative Energy developments, Electric and Hybrid Cars projects for Racing and Automotive applications.</p>

<p>Sergio also holds an MBA from Kingston University, UK, and his insight into both the design and business worlds are invaluable to TotalSim.</p>
